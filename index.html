<a name="basic-info" class="anchor" href="#basic-info"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work</h3>

<p>Just before my senior year, I left Princeton University to build <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/monday-qa-josh-miller-on-branch-comments-as-content-and-the-state-of-online-discourse/">Branch Media</a>, which was backed by the founders of Twitter and Buzzfeed. Our company designed experimental social products, such as <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670904/branch-rethinks-the-social-cliches-that-wrack-twitter-and-facebook">Branch</a> and <a href="http://fortune.com/2013/06/25/taking-online-discussions-up-a-notch/">Potluck</a>, that aimed to foster more thoughtful conversations on the internet. Branch's software was embedded within New York Times articles, used retired Army Generals, and even <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/ios-7-reportedly-delayed-due-significant-ui-overhaul-ipad-event-still-set-april-3438374/">broke big news</a> about Apple's iPhone design. 

 <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304549504579318583672821614">Facebook bought</a> Branch in January 2014, and I went on to work on new product development for the social media giant. In August 2015, I left Facebook to accept a role in President Obama's Administration.</p>

<p>Starting in September 2015, I served as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/josh-miller-leaves-facebook-for-the-white-house/">White House's first Director of Product</a>. Of the projects that I created and led, my favorite work included:
  
  <ul>
<li>An <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-enlists-silicon-valley-to-solve-a-132521740.html/">affordable diaper program</a> for low-income families - it cut prices by <a href="https://medium.com/the-white-house/surge-pricing-for-diapers-456df8b59c1f">over fifty percent</a> for the neediest parents (using a strategy that was economically sustainable for participating businesses). Millions of diapers were shipped to low-income families in the first six months alone, and some non-profits were able to double the number of diapers they could provide with the same amount of funding.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3062674/the-white-houses-new-facebook-messenger-bot-makes-it-easy-to-send-a-message-to-obama">first-ever government bot</a> on Facebook, which President Obama has personally <a href="https://www.facebook.com/potus/posts/526527297537115">responded to messages from</a>. By allowing citizens to message the President on Facebook in the same way that they message their friends, we set new volume records for inbound citizen correspondence.</li>
<li>A civic engagement initiative that mobilized tens of thousands of Americans to donate (millions) to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/world/middleeast/obama-turns-to-crowdfunding-to-aid-fleeing-syrians.html">refugee relief efforts in the Middle East</a>. Working with Kickstarter, Instacart and others, the aim was to make civic engagement as easy as your pushing a single button on your phone. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/us/refugees-us-obama-kickstarter.html"> dubbed it</a>, "a 21st-century twist on humanitarian assistance" and "a cunning way to work around the do-nothing corridors of official Washington." </li>
</ul></p>
       
<p> As a political appointee, I left the White House in January 2017.
