<p align="right"> September 1st, 2015</p>

<p> In 2008, I was finally old enough to participate in my first election. It was my freshman year in college, and Barack Obama got my vote – his intellect and ideals inspired me. So much so that after he was elected, I decided to spend the summer working for the government, as an intern for one of my Senators.</p>

<p> While answering phone calls and opening mail that summer, I became disillusioned with how elected officials interacted with their constituents. When people would reach out with passionate perspectives and genuine calls for help, they were generally met with inefficient and ineffective responses. The culprit wasn’t a lack of care, though; it was a lack of tools.</p>

<p> Frustrated, I wrote a memo to our Deputy Chief of Staff. It outlined how a simple internet application could improve how we engaged with the people we served. Unsurprisingly, the story ended there, but the experience motivated me to take my passion for creating novel technology products elsewhere. </p>

<p> Two summers later, I put my college studies on hold to create a technology startup, Branch. The software we built was also inspired by my time on Capitol Hill, and it was eventually employed by the likes of General Stanley McChrystal and the New York Times. After growing the company to ten people and two products, the Branch team joined Facebook. There, I have been leading the development of new web and mobile products ever since.</p>

<p> Now, I’m moving on to something new while also returning to an old problem that means a lot to me. This Monday, I start in a new role at the White House serving as their first Director of Product. I’m as giddy, wide-eyed, and determined as ever. The White House has many digital products – from WhiteHouse.gov to the We the People Petition site. It’s a dream to be able to add to and improve this portfolio.</p>

<p> In order to do that, my plan is to lean on the product ideals that I learned during the last four years building Branch and working at Facebook. Wouldn’t it be great if your government had a conversation with you instead of just talking at you? Imagine if talking to the government was as easy as talking to your friends on Facebook? I’m excited to take what I’ve learned from my time in the technology industry and apply it to the ideals of our democracy. As a mentor of mine likes to say, “It’s gonna be great!”</p>
